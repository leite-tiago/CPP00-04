# 💻 CPP Modules 00–04

This repository contains my solutions for modules **CPP00** to **CPP04** from the C++ curriculum of 42. Each module focuses on different core concepts of C++ programming, gradually building up a solid foundation in object-oriented development and modern C++ practices.

## 📚 Overview

### 🧩 CPP00 – Basics of C++
- Introduction to C++ syntax.
- Handling input/output streams.
- Creating and managing classes and member functions.

### 🧠 CPP01 – Memory and References
- Deep vs shallow copies.
- References and pointers.
- Dynamic memory management using `new` and `delete`.

### 🏗️ CPP02 – Operator Overloading
- Implementing operator overloads.
- Understanding fixed-point numbers.
- Improving class interfaces and usability.

### 🧬 CPP03 – Inheritance
- Classical inheritance.
- Constructors and destructors in inheritance trees.
- Introduction to polymorphism basics.

### 🧠 CPP04 – Polymorphism & Abstract Classes
- Abstract classes and interfaces.
- Virtual functions and overriding.
- Deep copies and resource management.

## 📁 Structure

```
CPP00-04/
├── CPP00/
├── CPP01/

```

Each module directory contains the relevant source files, headers, and Makefile.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- C++98 (standard enforced by 42)
- `clang++` with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`
- Makefile-based compilation

## 🧠 What I Learned

These modules taught me the fundamental principles of C++ from scratch, including memory handling, class design, inheritance, polymorphism, and more. They also improved my ability to write safe, modular, and reusable code following object-oriented principles.
